  - 10 seconds will be deducted from the time 
  - then the next question will appear
* If all the questions are answered within the given time limit
- user's time (score) will be display and user will be asked to 
  input their initials to be saved to the scoreboard
- when the user hits "submit-score" button
 - if their score falls in the range of the top 10 scores, their initials 
  and score will be displayed
